how_might_we: How might we create streamlined logistic systems for robot retailers?

product_narrative: |
  My Lil HealthBot is a startup that is trying to push the boundaries of retailing by transforming the way customers interact and make purchases with a machine. 

  Our studies and survey have shown that there are currently some glaring weaknesses in the traditional vending machine business model though. Perhaps the most egregious one is the fact that many customers purchase items from these machines fairly infrequently (less than once a month). Now how do most brick and mortar stores draw customers back? They use advertisements and promotions . 

  Unfortunately, we donâ€™t have the retail space or marketing budget. What our robotic retailer does have is a high traffic and mobile location. We can use this to our advantage to push highly personalized ads using beacon technology. We hope to communicate with our customers through very targeted notification to display reminders and discounts based on past purchasing data and seasonal events. We believe this can lead to more frequent purchases from our customers.
